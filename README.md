# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application for production into the `build` directory. This process effectively packages React in production mode and optimizes the build for top-tier performance.

The resulting build is condensed, and the filenames incorporate unique hashes. Your application is now prepared for deployment.

For further insights on deployment, please refer to the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the official documentation.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you find yourself unsatisfied with the choice of build tools and configurations, there is an option to eject at any time. This action will eliminate the sole build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will duplicate all the configuration files and related dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, granting you complete control over them. All commands, except for eject, will continue to function, but they will point to the duplicated scripts, allowing you to fine-tune them as needed. At this stage, you're in full control.

There's no obligation to utilize the eject feature. The pre-defined feature set is well-suited for small to mid-sized deployments, and you should never feel compelled to use this feature. However, we acknowledge that this tool may not be valuable if you can't customize it when the need arises.
